# MedievalRecipeTranslator


This is a single-page React web app for word-for-word translations of medieval recipes, deployed [here](https://gjcox.github.io/MedievalRecipeTranslatorApp/) on GitHub Pages. 

Translation is performed using a glossary adapted from one scraped with a [web scraper that I implemented](https://github.com/gjcox/MedievalGlossaryScraper). It is "word-for-word" translation, but the glossary includes multi-word phrases, and translation prioritises translating long recognised phrases over shorter phrases and single words. In the translation pane the substituted words and phrases are clickable, and alternate substitutions and extra information can be explored.
